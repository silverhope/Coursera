      <a class="title1"> Chicken </a> 
      <p>Our Famous Recipe Chicken is always cooked fresh, never frozen. Then it’s honey dipped, hand breaded in our special blend of herbs and spices and pressure cooked to seal in the flavor that put Lee’s on the map in the first place. We might hold on to our traditions a bit longer than others. But after one bite, you’ll see why.</p>
